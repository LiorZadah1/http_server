-I have several of private funcs that helps me in: error responding, file content respond and dir content respond. In addition another one to check premissions and if the file is Dir and exist. thank you.
    In this programming assignment, you will write an HTTP server. Students are not required
to implement the full HTTP specification, but only a very limited subset of it.
You will implement the following HTTP server that:
- Constructs an HTTP response based on the client's request.
- Sends the response to the client.
